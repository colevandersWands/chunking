learning objectives
* higher level analysis of variable usage
    * strategic: storing or compiling important states on the way to finished result
    * utility: anything else
* identifying chunks of code that do one complete & meaningful task
* isolating chunks, trying to make them rely on as few external variables as possible
* control structures (loops, conditionals): when is the whole thing a chunk, and when is the body a chunk

exercises:
* some snippets and the template
* no need for test cases, this is an analysis of one set of values. (but do run the file to make sure behavior is preserved, thus the console.logs)
